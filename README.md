# Algorithm-Comparision
A program that uses recursive or iterative Quick Sort algorithms to sort words in text files alphabetically. The execution times can later be compared.
I wrote this program in spring 2019 as part of a C++ programming class. Right now I'm cleaning it up to get used to C++ again because most programming I've done since then has been in Java.
